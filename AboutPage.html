        <h1>What is Maternal Mental Health?</h1>
        <p>
            Maternal mental health refers to the mental and emotional well-being of women during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period.<br>
            It encompasses a range of psychological conditions, from common mood changes to more serious mental health disorders.
        </p>
        <h1> Why is it Important?</h1>
        <p>
            Addressing maternal mental health is essential not only for the well-being of the mother but also for the baby’s development and the family’s overall health.<br>
            Early identification and intervention are crucial, as untreated mental health issues can have long-term consequences.<br>
            This is why it's important to raise awareness about maternal mental health, reduce stigma, and encourage open conversations about the emotional challenges of pregnancy and motherhood.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you or someone you know is struggling with maternal mental health, it’s important to seek help from a healthcare professional to get the support needed.<br>
            Our website was made for easy access and general information, consulting a professional in person is always the better option.
